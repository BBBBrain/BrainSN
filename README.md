# BrainSN Project
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of BrainSN (Brain States Network), a foundational fMRI model for representing continuous brain state information. The project provides a robust and scalable solution for model pretraining and downstream tasks analysis.

## Data preparation

We recommend reading and using the official website introduction and preprocessing process of each dataset below, and then using the brain map to calculate the final usable data. Here we use the [1000Parcels_Yeo2011_17Networks](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/blob/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Yan2023_homotopic/parcellations/MNI/yeo17/1000Parcels_Yeo2011_17Networks_FSLMNI152_2mm.nii.gz) , but you can choose different sizes and types for pre-training.
